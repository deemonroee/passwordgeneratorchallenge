# Password Generator Challenge

## Description

This topic was more on the trickier side just because the if statements had me a little confused but with this assignment I spent extra time to try to understand. I was motivated to complete this assignment just because of wanting to be able to interact with my code and see any errors that could occur and try to fix them. I learned how to create alerts on a page and be able to generate a random password. I learned how much it takes to be able to get it to operate and what each functions do. 

## Installation

To make the page run we needed to add functions and alerts windows so that the viewer can answer questions to generate a password. 

## Usage
I am unsure where to add the screenshots but I will try to edit it again and learn how to add in the screenshots
